Their orbit speed ratio is based off actual data and gives the animation a simple visual comparison, for example it takes Mars roughly twice as long to complete a orbit around the sun. Rather than leaving the orbit path blank I opted to draw strings of faint circles for each path. The animation is scaled down in the vertical axis giving it an added effect of depth. I've also added a MouseOver eventListener to make the animation interactive, it changes a planet's color red and display its name when the mouse is hovered over it. Note, the planets' size, distance and location are not scaled to real proportions. Made using HTML5 and JavaScript."
